<h2>Summary:</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">There has been observed a fundamental shift in optical networking
paradigms: The focus in network architectures is put on the
transition from static to dynamic-reconfigurable networks; many
new network architectures are based on passive or semi-passive
components, which replace active components and systems in the
field and thereby greatly reduce maintenance costs; they are also
based on shared network resources rather than dedicated ones; the
design of new optical network architectures is now driven not only
by performance but also by energy efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Major driving forces behind this shift are the mismatch between
current service/usage models and static network infrastructures,
and the unbalance in bandwidth between backbone and access
networks. The fixed and static nature of the current optical
networks makes difficult fast provisioning and cannot meet well
the varying user demands, which leads into inefficient use of
network resources and thereby results in poor energy
efficiency. Next-generation optical networks are trying to address
these issues by providing fast and easy reconfigurability through
network architectures based on tunable and passive components.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">These changes in the network design specifically focuses on the
way of using wavelengths. The traditional way is through WDM in a
point-to-point link and continuous-mode communications mainly to
increase the link capacity. The complexity and power consumption
of the switches/routers in central nodes in this case, however,
would be extremely high due to the need of very fast processing,
switching, and buffering mostly done in the electrical domain. On
the other hand, many next-generation architectures replace the
high-capacity switches/routers with distributed use of tunable
lasers and/or burst-mode, fixed receivers with
wavelength-selective passive or semi-passive intermediate nodes,
trying to efficiently assign and use the available network
resources, which results in higher energy efficiency as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The use of tunable transceivers has many advantages: It enables
network resource sharing in both time and wavelength domains. With
properly designed scheduling algorithms, it could provide
virtually the same performance with a smaller number of
transceivers compared to traditional WDM. Also, by dynamically
reassigning network resources and turning off unnecessary
transceivers during inactive periods, it can increase energy
efficiency. As for network protection and restoration, a pool of
tunable transceivers could still maintain normal operation without
interruption when some of them fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">There have been several works on multi-channel scheduling with
tunable transceivers in optical networks. Most of the works,
however, are specific to network architectures under consideration
and, because the major focus is on the delay and throughput
performance of the whole system, there is no support for fairness
and QoS guarantee in the flow level.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">To make further progress in the area of multi-channel scheduling
with tunable transceivers, we propose to develop a general
theoretical framework providing performance bounds and guiding
principles for the design of scheduling algorithms in hybrid
TDM/WDM optical networks with the following objectives: 1) To
extend the Fair Queueing (FQ) framework to the case of multiple
channels with tunable transmitters; 2) to design and evaluate the
performance of schedulers for hybrid TDM/WDM Passive Optical
Networks (PONs) providing fairness and QoS guarantee in the flow
level.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The outcomes from the proposed work could be directly applicable
to future hybrid TDM/WDM metro and access networks. Also, the
scheduling algorithms and their theoretical framework could be
generalised and applied to scheduling in other types of networks
(e.g., WLANs).</p>
