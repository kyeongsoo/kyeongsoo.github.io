<h2>Summary:</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In all of the studies carried out so far on the implementation of
broadband optical internet access, few have carried the vision as
far as the objective of the Photonics21 competition, &quot;10Gigabit/s
everywhere&quot;. The partners in this project, who represent the
majority of interested parties in the UK, will carry out a focused
road-mapping study, with the aim of identifying promising routes
forward in achieving the ambitious goals of Photonics21, while
making best use of the existing knowledge that has been gained in
earlier projects, which is not always in a form that is simple to
apply in the present context. We will seek the solutions which
show most promise of cost effectiveness, are future proof
(i.e. allowing bandwidth evolution and infrastructure reuse) and
allow simple interfaces which can be standardized. This task will
demand a high degree of innovation, facilitated by the vertically
integrated consortium structure. The results of the study will be
made available to UK industry in order to maximize the
opportunities for the UK in the next stage of development, which
will be conducted under the FP7 and ERANET+ schemes, leading
ultimately to commercial leadership in the world market for
next-generation optical internet access systems.</p>
